# Project Abonae

A Repository used to share and track data, metadata and paradata associated with my PhD into 3D modelling within the field of archaeology. I aim to tackle critiques levied at 3D tools and archaeology by explicitly exploring how broadly applicable the integration of these methods is to archaeologists looking to understand excavated buildings. This involves both a discussion of benefits to research and understanding, as well as efficiency and benefiting the broader research beyond a single site. 

The thesis fills a significant hole in the academic discourse that has been sorely missing and will provide a set of case studies that illustrate how these methods can be appropriately integrated into the archaeological process, binding together the previously scattered research. Busing a series of case studies from Albania and the United Kingdom I will illustrate new methods and frameworks. 

The case-studies in the United Kindom are catalogued here. [The wiki](https://github.com/atrbirkett/ABirkettPhD/wiki) has more details on the sites, methodologies used, and other information.
