The monument includes part of a minor Romano-British villa, situated on low ground just above the floodplain of the River Avon, near Avonmouth. The villa survives as both standing and buried remains of a winged corridor villa discovered in 1947 during the construction of a housing estate and excavated in 1948-50. It had been partially damaged by the construction of the modern Long Cross Road. Two 3rd century AD buildings were found, and the eastern part was fully excavated, conserved and is on public display. The building was almost symmetrical in plan and contained a bath suite and various rooms in the east and west wings. Sandstone-built walls, decorated wall plaster, several mosaic pavements and hypocausts in the living rooms and bath suite, as well as finds of domestic and everyday use and personal adornment were found.","ROMAN",43,410,10/03/2021 00:00:00,"EDIT ON 30/03/2021 09:49:03 BY Admin; "
