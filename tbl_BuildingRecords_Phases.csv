3,"1",1.00,"Between 268-270 A.D. the villa was constructed with two wings connected by two corridors, one an open colonnade, and the other partly enclosed, around a central court. To the north-west a small extension of a two-roomed bathhouse consisting of a Sudatorium and a Tepidarium was constructed which appears to only be accessible from the exterior.

The hypocaust of Room I and II were supported by pilae of stone slabs. These were positioned to allow the flag-stone floor of the rooms to be supported by the pilae and alleviate the necessity for a rebated ledge (Boon 1950, 31). Room I (the Sudatorium, which its northernmost end is now lost below the pavement, is unclear, Boon suggests the furnace entrance was to the west, however it is not clear if the presence of ash to the west is his sole proof of this (Boon 1950, 32). He also proposes that a water tank was inserted into the north wall above where the furnace channel begins (Boon 1950, 32, 35). 

The central court is described by Boon as being around 0.304 m (1 ft) lower than the portico floor level (Boon 1950, 19), creating a Sylobate (or step). This court would have been covered by rammed stone chips, and appears to have has a large rectangular heath measuring 1.219 × 2.133 m (Boon 1950, 37). 

The base-blocks of the portico pillars for this Period may have been the same used for the platform for Room XI in Period Two - B (Boon 1950, 19). The portico appears to be constructed in the Tuscan order with columns of Bath Stone at 0.292 – 0.304 m (11½”—12”) in diameter and were only preserved as fragments (Boon 1950, 19). Boon hypothesises that, as long as it follows the Vitruvian order of the diameter being one-tenth the height (Vitruvius, 4.8.1), the columns would have been 3.048 m high (Boon 1950, 19). A small foundation-burial of a piglet was deposited just inside the Porticus on the western side of the porch (Boon 1993, 82). 

The corridor to the north of the villa (Room XV) may have had an entrance reflecting that of the portico (Boon 1950, 38). Because of the poor preservation at the north end of the site, it is not clear if this possible entrance with evidence of two broken pillars and capitals, may have meant that this was a true reflection of the porticus. However, its presence could suggest that at least the entrance reflected that of the porticus.
It is possible that the porch was added around 300 A.D., however it is unclear if the floor layer around the portico is clearance debris from the alternations made to the porticus in the next phase (Boon 1950, 12). Furthermore, the wear on the porch threshold shows that the interior edge is substantially more worn than the outer edge, suggesting that the fill to create a level surface in the porch must have been fairly early in the villa’s life (Boon 1950, 14). This suggests that either the porch is very early alteration or, the date of Period Two-A was early in the life of the villa.

Boon also notes that the majority of this this period is only distinguished from Period Two by differing mortars and some differences in construction dimensions (Boon 1950, 13). However, it appears that Boon may only be referring to one small alternation to Room XV as the other changes are either alterations of Period 1 constructions or are clearly abutting walls (Boon 1950, 14).","","",,,"ROMAN",268,270
5,"2a",1.00,"This phase is mostly identified as the alternations of the porticus and porch. The porticus appears to have suffered from an engineering mistake, as the foundations of Room VII were thickened where the line of a drainage ditch crossed underneath. However, the colonnade received no simmilar support, therefore the substantial alteration and re-enforcement appears to have been to reduce the level of subsidence (Boon 1950, 13, 20–21).
This new porticus was altered to form an arcade of four arches either side of a pediment arch of the same width of the Period One opening (Boon 1950, 20). This pediment arch appears to have been proposed from the large span of the opening, which could not support an arch without an absurdly high and large arch. Boon suggests that this was supported by two of the Period A columns on either side, shortened to rest on a block of concreated rubble (Boon 1950, 21). 
The arches were supported by concreated rubble columns and based upon a low wall of an unknown height, as it was robbed post-occupation. It appears that arcade did not abut the eastern and western wall faces, and a shot solid stretch of wall acted as a buttress to further support the weight of the roof (Boon 1950, 20).  
It is not immediately clear what evidence suggests the number of arches or the presence of the ‘buttresses’ to the east and west. However, the presence of two voussiers, one impost and the shortened columns from Period One suggests that this is broadly substantiated. The impost measured 0.298 × 0.095 × 0.139 m (11¾” × 3¾” × 5½”). 
No certain date for this phase is given as no firm dating evidence was found in this construction layer, however I would pose that the terminus post quem of 300 AD (as attested by the porch debris and threshold wear) and a post anti quem of 340 AD (which is the date of Period Two-B).","","",,,"ROMAN",300,300
6,"2b",1.00,"This period adds Rooms III, IV and XIII, as well as splitting Room XII and XV with partition walls. The Hypocaust in Room XI is added by digging out the floor and “hacking” out a flue on the western wall. This is constructed to a considerably different level of skill than the hypocausts of Rooms I and II, where clean and deliberate walls are constructed, and the floor is supported by traditional tiled pilae compared to the monolithic pilae and baulks used in Room XI. On top of this hypocaust, a 0.152 m thick layer of opus signinum was laid, and a mosaic added (Boon 1993, 78). Room XII has its mosaic torn up, and the southern-most partition of room XII is converted to a furnace room (Boon 1950, 37). 
The extension, Room XIII, added to the east and the partition wall in Room XI were constructed in this period. It is not clear what the purpose of this partition was (Boon 1950, 38).
The extension of the bathhouse with a Frigidarium and Apodyterium (Rooms III and IV respectively). Rooms III and IV are __.__ m below the height of Room II. The cold bath of the Frigidarium is cut into the natural clay below the floor level of the room and is faced with brick mortar and pink plaster (Boon 1950, 36). This bath measures 1.447 × 0.660 m by 0.457 m deep, and must have had a raised lip as a drainage channel is cut into the floor and drops under the bath and out of the villa (Boon 1950, 36). The remains of an iron cruciform window lattice was found just outside Room III, as well as fragments of window glass (Boon 1950, 31).
This phase is mostly characterised by a different mortar usage and the reduced use of Carboniferous Limestone in the foundations (Boon 1950, 19), and is dated with a terminus anti quem of 340 AD by a collection of six lightly warn coins dating to between 330—337 AD (Boon 1950, 19).","","",,,"ROMAN",300,340
7,"3",1.00,"The final phase adds an extension to the Apodyterium, suggested as a later date than Rooms III and IV as the foundations abut against that phase of construction. However, it appears that this was never completed as suggested by the lack of rubble covering this phase of construction, that, if fully completed, would have been substantially deeper than was excavated (Boon 1950, 15–16). It appears that this later phase was, at least, some time before the final abandonment. The purpose of the room is not immediately obvious, as it was never completed, however Boon suggests that it may have been intended as a latrine or secondary cold bath (Boon 1950, 36).
The dating for this room is unclear, being no earlier than 340 AD. However, two coins from the reign of Constantine dated to no earlier than 337 were discovered in the spoil and occupation layer of this room (Boon 1950, 42).","","",,,"ROMAN",337,367
8,"4",1.00,"Since coins from the reign of Valentinian I, Valens, and Gratian, dated to 367 – 383, appear in the destruction layer of the Porticus and the occupation layer of Rooms XII and XIII, it suggests a terminus post quem of some degree of abandonment of before 367 AD (Boon 1950, 44–45; Boon 1993, 79). 
The destruction of the porticus is unusual, since there appears to be little evidence to suggest that the Severn suffered from raids during The Great Conspiracy of 367/8 AD (Boon 1993, 79–80; cf. Boon 1950, 17–18). Boon in his 1950 report suggests that the evidence of burning in Rooms III and VIII suggests that the building suffered some damage, but that the portico likely fell due to natural abandonment rather than outright demolition (Boon 1950, 16–17).","","",,,"ROMAN",367,378
9,"5",1.00,"A platform to enter Room XI was built on top of the ruins of the portico, using some of its material, at an unknown date (Boon 1950, 18). It appears that this platform was used for some time, as significant wear exists on its surface (Boon 1993, 79–80). The remains of a fifty-year-old male were discovered to between the two northern baulks just south of the furnace entrance may be associated with this later occupation of around the Dark Ages (Boon 1950, 18; Boon 1993; BaRAS 1995, 5). He appears to have been killed with an axe blow, or other bladed weapon, to the head (Boon 1993, 77–80). No Carbon 14 dating has been conducted on the skeleton, however a small Dark Age vessel was discovered during consolidation work in the mid-1990s (BaRAS 1995, 5).","	","	",,,"EARLY MEDIEVAL",410,1066
